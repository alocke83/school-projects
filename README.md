Python scripts I prepared when I was learning Python.


In scripting fundamentals I studied Python as a formal student.  In the class we covered key fundamentals like functions, classes, logic, and a number of critical Python libraries like time and handliong text files.  To improve the function of my code and develop skills needed to immediately turn what I learned to practical value at my office I also learned how to handle csv and tkinter.  I'm excited to learn more libraries and add to my ability to contribute.

I got a perfect score on the final code submission because I not only met but exceeded the design requirements.  The final is a triva quiz script, in addition to tabulating correct and incorrect answers at the end of the quiz, my quiz leverages csv to commit to a record the results of your attempt at my LOTR trivia quiz.  The quiz also uses csv to pull questions from a spreadsheet containing some 40 or so hardcore questions I created over the course of a week or so.  The benefits are that the quiz is expandable without making any changes to the code by simply adding new questions to the csv, and that my quiz features a high score table.  I took the csv tricks to work where I paired them with the sqlite3 library to manage and create a database for a project.
