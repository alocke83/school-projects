Python scripts I prepared when I was learning Python.


In scripting fundamentals I studied Python as a formal student.  In the class we covered key fundamentals like functions, classes, logic, and a number of critical Python libraries like time and handliong text files.  To improve the function of my code and develop skills needed to immediately turn what I learned to practical value at my office I also learned how to handle csv and tkinter.  I'm excited to learn more libraries and add to my ability to contribute.
